Usage: esl-sfetch [options] <sqfile> <name>        (one seq named <name>)
Usage: esl-sfetch [options] -f <sqfile> <namefile> (all seqs in <namefile>)
Usage: esl-sfetch [options] --index <sqfile>       (index <sqfile>)

 where general options are:
  -h     : help; show brief info on version and usage
  -o <f> : output sequences to file <f> instead of stdout
  -O     : output sequence to file named <key>
  -n <s> : rename the sequence <s>
  -r     : reverse complement the seq(s)

 Options for retrieving subsequences:
  -c <s> : retrieve subsequence coords <from>..<to>
  -C     : <namefile> in <f> contains subseq coords too

  On command line, subseq coords are separated by any nonnumeric, nonspace character(s).
  for example, -c 23..100 or -c 23/100 or -c 23-100 all work.

  Additionally, to retrieve a suffix to the end, omit the end coord or set it to zero; -c 23.. 
  will work, as will -c 23..0

  By default, the subseq will be named <source name>/<from>-<to>. To assign a name of
  your choice, use -n <newname>.

  In retrieving subsequences listed in a file (-C -f, or just -Cf), each line of the file
  is in GDF format: <newname> <from> <to> <source seqname>, space/tab delimited.

  When <start> coordinate is greater than <end>, for DNA or RNA, the reverse complement is
  retrieved; in protein sequence, this is an error. The -r option is another way to revcomp.

 other options:
  --informat <s> : specify that input file is in format <s>

SED(1)                      General Commands Manual                     SED(1)

NAME
     sed – stream editor

SYNOPSIS
     sed [-Ealnru] command [-I extension] [-i extension] [file ...]
     sed [-Ealnru] [-e command] [-f command_file] [-I extension]
         [-i extension] [file ...]

DESCRIPTION
     The sed utility reads the specified files, or the standard input if no
     files are specified, modifying the input as specified by a list of
     commands.  The input is then written to the standard output.

     A single command may be specified as the first argument to sed.  Multiple
     commands may be specified by using the -e or -f options.  All commands
     are applied to the input in the order they are specified regardless of
     their origin.

     The following options are available:

     -E      Interpret regular expressions as extended (modern) regular
             expressions rather than basic regular expressions (BRE's).  The
             re_format(7) manual page fully describes both formats.

     -a      The files listed as parameters for the “w” functions are created
             (or truncated) before any processing begins, by default.  The -a
             option causes sed to delay opening each file until a command
             containing the related “w” function is applied to a line of
             input.

     -e command
             Append the editing commands specified by the command argument to
             the list of commands.

     -f command_file
             Append the editing commands found in the file command_file to the
             list of commands.  The editing commands should each be listed on
             a separate line.  The commands are read from the standard input
             if command_file is “-”.

     -I extension
             Edit files in-place, saving backups with the specified extension.
             If a zero-length extension is given, no backup will be saved.  It
             is not recommended to give a zero-length extension when in-place
             editing files, as you risk corruption or partial content in
             situations where disk space is exhausted, etc.

             Note that in-place editing with -I still takes place in a single
             continuous line address space covering all files, although each
             file preserves its individuality instead of forming one output
             stream.  The line counter is never reset between files, address
             ranges can span file boundaries, and the “$” address matches only
             the last line of the last file.  (See Sed Addresses.) That can
             lead to unexpected results in many cases of in-place editing,
             where using -i is desired.

     -i extension
             Edit files in-place similarly to -I, but treat each file
             independently from other files.  In particular, line numbers in
             each file start at 1, the “$” address matches the last line of
             the current file, and address ranges are limited to the current
             file.  (See Sed Addresses.) The net result is as though each file
             were edited by a separate sed instance.

     -l      Make output line buffered.

     -n      By default, each line of input is echoed to the standard output
             after all of the commands have been applied to it.  The -n option
             suppresses this behavior.

     -r      Same as -E for compatibility with GNU sed.

     -u      Make output unbuffered.

     The form of a sed command is as follows:

           [address[,address]]function[arguments]

     Whitespace may be inserted before the first address and the function
     portions of the command.

     Normally, sed cyclically copies a line of input, not including its
     terminating newline character, into a pattern space, (unless there is
     something left after a “D” function), applies all of the commands with
     addresses that select that pattern space, copies the pattern space to the
     standard output, appending a newline, and deletes the pattern space.

     Some of the functions use a hold space to save all or part of the pattern
     space for subsequent retrieval.

Sed Addresses
     An address is not required, but if specified must have one of the
     following formats:

           •   a number that counts input lines cumulatively across input
               files (or in each file independently if a -i option is in
               effect);

           •   a dollar (“$”) character that addresses the last line of input
               (or the last line of the current file if a -i option was
               specified);

           •   a context address that consists of a regular expression
               preceded and followed by a delimiter.  The closing delimiter
               can also optionally be followed by the “I” character, to
               indicate that the regular expression is to be matched in a
               case-insensitive way.

     A command line with no addresses selects every pattern space.

     A command line with one address selects all of the pattern spaces that
     match the address.

     A command line with two addresses selects an inclusive range.  This range
     starts with the first pattern space that matches the first address.  The
     end of the range is the next following pattern space that matches the
     second address.  If the second address is a number less than or equal to
     the line number first selected, only that line is selected.  The number
     in the second address may be prefixed with a (“+”) to specify the number
     of lines to match after the first pattern.  In the case when the second
     address is a context address, sed does not re-match the second address
     against the pattern space that matched the first address.  Starting at
     the first line following the selected range, sed starts looking again for
     the first address.

     Editing commands can be applied to non-selected pattern spaces by use of
     the exclamation character (“!”) function.

Sed Regular Expressions
     The regular expressions used in sed, by default, are basic regular
     expressions (BREs, see re_format(7) for more information), but extended
     (modern) regular expressions can be used instead if the -E flag is given.
     In addition, sed has the following two additions to regular expressions:

     1.   In a context address, any character other than a backslash (“\”) or
          newline character may be used to delimit the regular expression.
          The opening delimiter needs to be preceded by a backslash unless it
          is a slash.  For example, the context address \xabcx is equivalent
          to /abc/.  Also, putting a backslash character before the delimiting
          character within the regular expression causes the character to be
          treated literally.  For example, in the context address \xabc\xdefx,
          the RE delimiter is an “x” and the second “x” stands for itself, so
          that the regular expression is “abcxdef”.

     2.   The escape sequence \n matches a newline character embedded in the
          pattern space.  You cannot, however, use a literal newline character
          in an address or in the substitute command.

     One special feature of sed regular expressions is that they can default
     to the last regular expression used.  If a regular expression is empty,
     i.e., just the delimiter characters are specified, the last regular
     expression encountered is used instead.  The last regular expression is
     defined as the last regular expression used as part of an address or
     substitute command, and at run-time, not compile-time.  For example, the
     command “/abc/s//XXX/” will substitute “XXX” for the pattern “abc”.

Sed Functions
     In the following list of commands, the maximum number of permissible
     addresses for each command is indicated by [0addr], [1addr], or [2addr],
     representing zero, one, or two addresses.

     The argument text consists of one or more lines.  To embed a newline in
     the text, precede it with a backslash.  Other backslashes in text are
     deleted and the following character taken literally.

     The “r” and “w” functions take an optional file parameter, which should
     be separated from the function letter by white space.  Each file given as
     an argument to sed is created (or its contents truncated) before any
     input processing begins.

     The “b”, “r”, “s”, “t”, “w”, “y”, “!”, and “:” functions all accept
     additional arguments.  The following synopses indicate which arguments
     have to be separated from the function letters by white space characters.

     Two of the functions take a function-list.  This is a list of sed
     functions separated by newlines, as follows:

           { function
             function
             ...
             function
           }

     The “{” can be preceded by white space and can be followed by white
     space.  The function can be preceded by white space.  The terminating “}”
     must be preceded by a newline, and may also be preceded by white space.

     [2addr] function-list
             Execute function-list only when the pattern space is selected.

     [1addr]a\
     text    Write text to standard output immediately before each attempt to
             read a line of input, whether by executing the “N” function or by
             beginning a new cycle.

     [2addr]b[label]
             Branch to the “:” function with the specified label.  If the
             label is not specified, branch to the end of the script.

     [2addr]c\
     text    Delete the pattern space.  With 0 or 1 address or at the end of a
             2-address range, text is written to the standard output.

     [2addr]d
             Delete the pattern space and start the next cycle.

     [2addr]D
             Delete the initial segment of the pattern space through the first
             newline character and start the next cycle.

     [2addr]g
             Replace the contents of the pattern space with the contents of
             the hold space.

     [2addr]G
             Append a newline character followed by the contents of the hold
             space to the pattern space.

     [2addr]h
             Replace the contents of the hold space with the contents of the
             pattern space.

     [2addr]H
             Append a newline character followed by the contents of the
             pattern space to the hold space.

     [1addr]i\
     text    Write text to the standard output.

     [2addr]l
             (The letter ell.)  Write the pattern space to the standard output
             in a visually unambiguous form.  This form is as follows:

                   backslash          \\
                   alert              \a
                   form-feed          \f
                   carriage-return    \r
                   tab                \t
                   vertical tab       \v

             Nonprintable characters are written as three-digit octal numbers
             (with a preceding backslash) for each byte in the character (most
             significant byte first).  Long lines are folded, with the point
             of folding indicated by displaying a backslash followed by a
             newline.  The end of each line is marked with a “$”.

     [2addr]n
             Write the pattern space to the standard output if the default
             output has not been suppressed, and replace the pattern space
             with the next line of input.

     [2addr]N
             Append the next line of input to the pattern space, using an
             embedded newline character to separate the appended material from
             the original contents.  Note that the current line number
             changes.

     [2addr]p
             Write the pattern space to standard output.

     [2addr]P
             Write the pattern space, up to the first newline character to the
             standard output.

     [1addr]q
             Branch to the end of the script and quit without starting a new
             cycle.

     [1addr]r file
             Copy the contents of file to the standard output immediately
             before the next attempt to read a line of input.  If file cannot
             be read for any reason, it is silently ignored and no error
             condition is set.

     [2addr]s/regular expression/replacement/flags
             Substitute the replacement string for the first instance of the
             regular expression in the pattern space.  Any character other
             than backslash or newline can be used instead of a slash to
             delimit the RE and the replacement.  Within the RE and the
             replacement, the RE delimiter itself can be used as a literal
             character if it is preceded by a backslash.

             An ampersand (“&”) appearing in the replacement is replaced by
             the string matching the RE.  The special meaning of “&” in this
             context can be suppressed by preceding it by a backslash.  The
             string “\#”, where “#” is a digit, is replaced by the text
             matched by the corresponding backreference expression (see
             re_format(7)).

             A line can be split by substituting a newline character into it.
             To specify a newline character in the replacement string, precede
             it with a backslash.

             The value of flags in the substitute function is zero or more of
             the following:

                   N       Make the substitution only for the N'th occurrence
                           of the regular expression in the pattern space.

                   g       Make the substitution for all non-overlapping
                           matches of the regular expression, not just the
                           first one.

                   p       Write the pattern space to standard output if a
                           replacement was made.  If the replacement string is
                           identical to that which it replaces, it is still
                           considered to have been a replacement.

                   w file  Append the pattern space to file if a replacement
                           was made.  If the replacement string is identical
                           to that which it replaces, it is still considered
                           to have been a replacement.

                   i or I  Match the regular expression in a case-insensitive
                           way.

     [2addr]t [label]
             Branch to the “:” function bearing the label if any substitutions
             have been made since the most recent reading of an input line or
             execution of a “t” function.  If no label is specified, branch to
             the end of the script.

     [2addr]w file
             Append the pattern space to the file.

     [2addr]x
             Swap the contents of the pattern and hold spaces.

     [2addr]y/string1/string2/
             Replace all occurrences of characters in string1 in the pattern
             space with the corresponding characters from string2.  Any
             character other than a backslash or newline can be used instead
             of a slash to delimit the strings.  Within string1 and string2, a
             backslash followed by any character other than a newline is that
             literal character, and a backslash followed by an ``n'' is
             replaced by a newline character.

     [2addr]!function
     [2addr]!function-list
             Apply the function or function-list only to the lines that are
             not selected by the address(es).

     [0addr]:label
             This function does nothing; it bears a label to which the “b” and
             “t” commands may branch.

     [1addr]=
             Write the line number to the standard output followed by a
             newline character.

     [0addr]
             Empty lines are ignored.

     [0addr]#
             The “#” and the remainder of the line are ignored (treated as a
             comment), with the single exception that if the first two
             characters in the file are “#n”, the default output is
             suppressed.  This is the same as specifying the -n option on the
             command line.

ENVIRONMENT
     The COLUMNS, LANG, LC_ALL, LC_CTYPE and LC_COLLATE environment variables
     affect the execution of sed as described in environ(7).

EXIT STATUS
     The sed utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.

EXAMPLES
     Replace ‘bar’ with ‘baz’ when piped from another command:

           echo "An alternate word, like bar, is sometimes used in examples." | sed 's/bar/baz/'

     Using backlashes can sometimes be hard to read and follow:

           echo "/home/example" | sed  's/\/home\/example/\/usr\/local\/example/'

     Using a different separator can be handy when working with paths:

           echo "/home/example" | sed 's#/home/example#/usr/local/example#'

     Replace all occurances of ‘foo’ with ‘bar’ in the file test.txt, without
     creating a backup of the file:

           sed -i '' -e 's/foo/bar/g' test.txt

     awk(1), ed(1), grep(1), regex(3), re_format(7)

STANDARDS
     The sed utility is expected to be a superset of the IEEE Std 1003.2
     (“POSIX.2”) specification.

     The -E, -I, -a and -i options, the special meaning of -f -, the prefixing
     “+” in the second member of an address range, as well as the “I” flag to
     the address regular expression and substitution command are non-standard
     FreeBSD extensions and may not be available on other operating systems.

HISTORY
     A sed command, written by L. E. McMahon, appeared in Version 7 AT&T UNIX.

BUGS
     Multibyte characters containing a byte with value 0x5C (ASCII ‘\’) may be
     incorrectly treated as line continuation characters in arguments to the
     “a”, “c” and “i” commands.  Multibyte characters cannot be used as
     delimiters with the “s” and “y” commands.
