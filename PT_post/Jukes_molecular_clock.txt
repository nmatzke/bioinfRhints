Realizing that this is true is what led to the understanding and acceptance of a molecular clock based on the amino acid sequences of homologous proteins.

Sadly, I'm not certain that most of the people teaching introductory biochemistry understand this point and I'm pretty sure that most high school teachers would have no idea what Jukes is talking about.
Jukes' thesis used to be on display in my department's library (Dept. of Biochemistry, University of Toronto). I hope it's still there.
