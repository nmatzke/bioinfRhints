Hi all,

It seems we are going to attempt a ~30-40 day response to mBio with moderate work (but not extreme) and with a view to strong pushback on Rev#2 not understanding the approach.

 

We discussed following immediate tasks:

Prepare structural overview figure with all known MotAB/ZorAB structures highlighting our defined modules on this (Pietro?)
Gather organismal data and github data that was prepared previously for consideration of a new main text figure that gives context (Caroline?).
Prepare graphical abstract figure (flowchart) with the purpose for explaining how the protein phylogenetics approach works here, ie, finding homologues, calculating homology, defining clades, defining structural motifs and inferring clading. (Nick?)
Other things mentioned:
SI heatmap for which motifs (TGI4, TGI5?) in which clades.
More direct mention of some of the extensive SI, ie full Newicks, full tables of information.
Our target I think is to submit this first week April so it is back with journal as there is still probably 50% chance rejection anyway so want to just do a quick assertive response. If reject, would go to phylogenetic journal eg Journal of Phylogenetic Evolution or BioEssays or BMC Bioinformatics.
We will try to meet weekly to keep some momentum on it, this will be Sydney 10am Tue 25th Feb next meeting (= 12pm NZ, = 7am Korea = 5pm Wisconsin).
 

Thanks,

Matt.
