Pre-calculated protein profiles are available for download here:

https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/download/Pfam/


These may be useful for aligning our sequences against these profiles, via hmmalign




I downloaded:
Pfam-A Seed alignment	Annotation and seed alignments of all Pfam-A families in Pfam format.

...and copied out the relevant profiles (MotA, MotB, homologs etc.) to separate text/hmm files.


We could maybe do this with the 

Pfam-A Full alignment	Annotation and full alignments of all Pfam-A families in Pfam format.

...which is 4 times bigger, but I bet the difference is marginal.
