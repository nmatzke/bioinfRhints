"Based on the organization of the GldLM transmembrane helices and on the structural homology of the transmembrane part of GldLM to the ion-driven motor complexes that drive bacterial flagella (17, 18), we proposed that GldLM forms a rotary motor in which the GldM subunits rotate within the ring of GldL helices (11, 17). The periplasmic domain of GldM is then envisaged to transmit this rotary motion across the periplasm to the outer membrane components of the T9SS and gliding motility systems."

"Here, we present structures of the T9SS/gliding motor core from the human pathogens P. gingivalis and Capnocytophaga canimorsus and the environmental bacteria Schleiferia thermophila and Sphingobacterium wenxiniae."

Here, we present cryo-electron microscopy structures of the gliding motility/type 9 protein secretion system motors GldLM from Flavobacterium johnsoniae and PorLM from Porphyromonas gingivalis. The motor is an asymmetric inner membrane protein complex in which the single transmembrane helices of two periplasm-spanning GldM/PorM proteins are positioned inside a ring of five GldL/PorL proteins. 


During the biogenesis of the gliding motility apparatus the adhesin proteins are trafficked to the cell surface by the type 9 secretion system (T9SS)13,16 (Fig. 1a). The T9SS is a Bacteroidetes-specific outer membrane protein transporter which in the dental pathogen Porphyromonas gingivalis is an essential virulence determinant.17. Unexpectedly, the gliding motility motor proteins GldL and GldM are essential for type 9 protein secretion13,16 even in Bacteroidetes species that do not glide16, such as P. gingivalis, where they are named PorL and PorM. Here, we report molecular and structural analysis of the GldLM and PorLM complexes involved in gliding motility and type 9 secretion.
